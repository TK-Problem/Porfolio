I also suffer from incurable boredom and insufferable impatience, so instead of waiting for others to help me do something, I’d rather look it up and figure it out myself. So no, I wouldn’t make a very good delegator. I have an insatiable desire to do everything myself, because I don’t like feeling like being able to see the big picture. I may also have control issues…

I learn best by doing and everything I’ve learned is because I taught myself. That’s how I ended up as a BI Developer – with my main focus on Tableau. That said, I am also familiar with Power BI, Alteryx, Google Data Studio, AWS Quicksights and truthfully any platform clients happen to need require at the time. I love learning, so I’m always willing to pick up a new skill if and when I have to.

While I’m labelled as a “Tableau Developer”, my love affair with data has very little to do with the Data Visualization aspect and more to do with taking data in its raw form; reshaping it into something more useful when necessary, and having the floor to freely present that information in a way that best shows it off. If data were a musical prodigy, I’d be its agent…

(No, I won’t be using cheesy analogies if we should work together, don’t worry.)

Besides, if you’re ever bored on the job, you’re always welcome to call me up and try and get some Spanish, French, Greek, Afrikaans or Filipino out of me. I have frequent love affairs with languages (even non-human ones, too… aka programming languages), but in typical fling-fashion, I tend to jump from one to another too quickly before mastering any. I’m sure it would be interesting to hear me attempt to prove otherwise, though."

I'm a data scientist / analyst and an expert R programmer. I am strong with ggplot (ggplot2 data visualisation) and I am also a Shiny App developer. I can create custom dashboards for your data with intelligent analytics and interactive graphics. 

I program in R 6 days a week and I am very confident with all aspects of a data analysis project. I use mostly the very powerful packages created by Hadley Wickham (data import, cleaning and tidying (tidyr), manipulation (dplyr), visualisation (ggplot2) and reporting (Shiny)). The list of online certificates (below) is a good indication of the focus of my skills.

To understand the power of these tools for creating dashboards I suggest you take a look at RStudio's Shiny gallery (shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

I have participated in the Master R Developer Workshop by RStudio, thaught by no other than Hadley Wickham himself. My expert knowledge in R extends to high quality functional programming, package building, meta-programming and more.

I have a Master Degree in Theoretical Physics from Sussex University (UK) and very strong understanding of analytics and machine learning, including neural networks (which I studied at Uni), support Vector machines, RandomForest, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and much more. Including the tools to train machine learning models I also have a fundamental understanding and set of tools to apply the correct models for specific situations.

🤔The 4-1-1🤔

Learning new things and expecting new unique challenges has always been a passion of mine. My favorite thing when it comes to professional skills is working with data. I love working with DATA!! Especially using it to help our business grow. The second thing favorite professional skill (more like topic) is improving and grow small businesses. I enjoy problem-solving and creating solutions to improve processes within organizations.

But my favorite thing in the world is having a lifestyle that allows me to spend time with my five kids. My goal with our business is to make as much of it as possible automated (thank you data science and programming skills). That way we can enjoy our life with our kids and not be bond to the standard 9 to 5.

💼Experience 💼
 

After serving in the US Navy🎖️ for 8 years (where I gained over 1,500 flight ✈️ hours, no small feat for a man afraid of heights) and completing 2 deployments, my wife and I followed our 'entrepreneurial spirit' and went head first!

Solving business problems with data is where most of my experience.  Yeah, there is eCommerce and entrepreneurship, but man the problems solving is what I love!!  I helped all types of organizations.  

💥💥💥 Here are some of the projects I have helped along my journey 💥💥💥

🏭 - I helped solve a mathematical issue with a gas pipeline in the UK, which helped detect a large gas leak saving 6 homes.
👗 - I helped a startup app (in the laundry space) organization understand their sales team data improving conversion and employee and reducing employee retained.  Not to mention discovering new markets that help earn profitability in less than six months after entry.  This was done with some machine learning models.
🏪 - I helped an Amazon Ad agency streamline their reporting reducing their labor time by 75% (Big chunk of change saved there 💰).  This reporting system helped them more than double their clients in less than a year.
🤑 - I helped a consultant discover over $4M in potential lost revenue to a large Australian big chain retailer.  You should have seen their amazement when they saw that number.  We found where the chain was wasting marketing dollars and focused on the products that mattered most.
And many more!!!


🎓Education🎓

My educational background is fairly straightforward. I earned my bachelor's degree from Saint Leo University (ACSPB accredited) in Business with an emphasis on Management and a minor in Marketing. My first Master of Science Degree was completed in 2017 from Jacksonville University (AACSB accredited) in Organizational Leadership, with a GPA of 3.7. I am currently in the last class of my second Master of Science Degree in Applied Business Analytics (also from JU). Because (as I mentioned above) I love learning new things and am clearly somewhat crazy, I plan to continue my education and finish my Doctoral degree."

Ever since, I have been amazed by the complexity of coral reefs which led me to study and focus on reef dynamics. However, due to various disturbances which led to the rapid decline of coral reef population worldwide, I was challenged to develop and perfected a cost-efficient coral reef restoration technique which I had formally written as a public document, unpublished manuscript and as a dissertation on my Masters Degree in Environmental Science wherein I was able to present it in various symposiums and forum. Furthermore, my passion in studying coral reef dynamics has led me to the understanding of interaction between marine ecosystems which currently lead me to research on SOME PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES ON CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY AND ADAPTATION OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS.

I am also a certified dive instructor catering to diver education, certification and guided underwater safari tours. However, with the knowledge gained from my reef restoration project, I am currently engaging on commercial diving like underwater salvaging, exploration and other underwater technical works and supervision in a relatively affordable rate. I also engaged in recreational triathlon with specialization on road cycling. I am also privileged to work in the Philippine Government, as a public servant working with the fisheries and environment sector.

With all these specialty skills and technical capabilities plus being an optimistic person, I can easily put hard to describe situations, processes and analysis (. . . etc) into words forming a language easily understood and appealing to read. This is aided by my relatively high level of English literacy having an Academic IELTS rating of 7.5 general average. I specialize in proposal writing and thesis / dissertation making, development and packaging. Furthermore, I can easily be instructed with minimal or no supervision required meeting deadlines on time.    

SO WITH THESE BACKGROUNDS, I CAN BE SURE TO MEET YOUR DEMANDS AND NEEDS.  

So, what are you waiting for. HIRE ME.

Thank you very much.

I use a simple proactive approach by taking action to achieve what is desired through control and results.

Seeking opportunities for advancement and individual accomplishment within a position of power and authority enabled with the freedom to make quick decisions whenever necessary.

Expert troubleshooting issues and solving problems do not intimidate, even if this means questioning the status quo. 

Never a problem tackling varied activities and embracing a wide range of tasks. In fact, some of the best work has been when receiving difficult assignments or getting the occasional worldview shocker. 

Identify milestones and setting a pace to accomplish each. This can be challenging, though, because of built-in controls or limitations by others. Heavy opposition or distracting events do not affect an unwavering focus on accomplishing goals. 

Many people appreciate being direct they don’t have to second-guess what is said. 
Serving as an inspiration to others who might be reticent to share their opinions and ideas freely or who may shy away from taking chances and trying new things. 

Usually not limited by doing things the same old way and unafraid to rock the boat, or even tip it, if the urge hits me. 

Goal-oriented and decisive to benefit the bottom line for your organization. 

I hope to hear from you soon. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I am creating automated data extraction systems for more than 6+ years now. Any security can be bypassed.

I have already scraped millions of records out of dozens of websites. Some of the websites were secured (banning IP address, showing no results, etc.). Proxy support is a must when we are talking about secured web sites. Randomizing them with every request increases chances of not being caught by automated security systems.

To get the most within the shortest period of time I am running several scrape scripts. It helps me to scrape much faster than most of other scrapers. Running multiple scripts is crucial when we need to get the results as fast as possible.

• Customizable data processing, modeling, and reporting pipelines;

• Custom python packages helping in your day-to-day data analytics work?


In this case, I can help you. I have plenty of experience in Data Analytics and Machine Learning and I have successfully unearthed relationships in my clients' time series data several times. In one case, my healthcare data visualizations even helped our client to secure their next eight-figure funding round.


Once you look through my portfolio, you will see that I conducted time series analysis involving the health, energy, and financial sectors.


🔥 WHY HIRE ME?

I am a constant learner. I acquired three Masters and a Ph.D. in economics, the social sciences, and science and technology studies simply because I was interested. To become a Data Scientist, however, I learned the skills 'out of school'.

""Why would you do this?"" you may ask.

Because I am enjoying it, for one.

Also because, next to learning, I am interested in impact and results. I believe that knowledge is valuable when it is applied and actionable. And Data Science is all about that.


""Ok, this is nice, but how does this benefit me?"" ― you might wonder.

There are three unique ways in which working with me will profit you.

1. When I work for you, I focus on the impact and results of analytics, that is, on the value it will deliver for you.

2. Instead of blinding you with opaque technical jargon, I pinpoint and effectively communicate to you the results' effect on your business.

3. I embrace new and complex problems. So, when that 'unexpected issue' shows its face, I either solve it or point you to the solution.


But you should not take only my word for it. You can read my clients' testimonials just right below.

🛠 HOW WILL WE WORK 

I use both my business and technical skills to specify your problem and the required tasks. This is to ensure that we are on the same page and that you know in advance what you are paying for.


By default, I am big on planning and structured in execution. But, if you need me, I can also be quick, open, and flexible as I have more than two years of Agile experience.

Thousands of dollars sunk into a system that barely worked. Hidden gaps in the data popping up everywhere. Upset partners. Angry clients. And their CEO ready to “pull the plug” on their startup after another VC pitch was botched by demoing with incomplete and low quality data.

Several other scraping experts (including two former G***le data scientists) had attempted to solve the problems and failed. They were truly frustrated. 

In a last ditch effort to salvage their startup they shared the complete story with me. 

Drawing on my 15+ years experience I put their system into a high stress test environment. Ferreted out all the errors. Plugged all holes where their system was leaking data. And filled the gaps in the existing data to get it ready for the next demo ...

The result? Two exhausting weeks later success was back. VC’s impressed by a demo with complete data. Clients delighted by the latest update. And the CEO asking me to become their new CTO.

Well, good for me I didn’t accept her offer. I’m too much in love with being a freelancer.

Good for you, too. As I’m now here to help you. I truly hope you are far from a similar situation, so contact me to make sure you really are. And let me prove that I am more than just a firefighter. At the end of it all you, too, may end up posting such a “this guy rocks” review.

I can’t solve every problem. Some challenges in certain projects are just too great to overcome. And while I sometimes can do the impossible, I would rather be known for taking care of all my clients from the beginning to the end of the project, providing a smooth and painless project experience that many call the absolute best experience in working with freelancers they have ever had.

Like this guy:

""Lots of people wrote ""this guy rocks"". And that is simply true. Ruediger is extremely smart and clear and the quality is extraordinary."" 
- a Client @upwork 

That's why I can guarantee results: you are satisfied or you pay nothing. Period.

What I can do for you:

1. Scraping unstructured data from websites, online directories, web archives etc for Research and Data Acquisition

2. Building systems for market intelligence that scan websites continuously for changes in price, product listings, etc … in almost any market imaginable (I’ve seen and built such projects for retailers, in real estate, building equipment and some more)

3. Extracting data for Lead Enrichment and Lead Generation - improve your marketing efforts with data that’s available on the web

4. Anything else data and web automation related that comes to your mind – invite me to your project and we can discuss what can be done.

You need me, if:

- the data source is difficult to scrape and others have failed already
- you have complex data that needs intense restructuring and cleanup
- you need the data prepared and imported into database structures ranging from MySQL to complex Hadoop or Spark clusters
- the data is highly unstructured and requires the use of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Deep Learning algorithms for cleanup and restructuring

Your benefits of working with me: 

1. Things will run smoothly like on autopilot. You won’t get another employee-like guy who needs babysitting, micromanagement and has to be pushed to work.

2. Open communication: you will receive project updates from me at least once a week, if necessary even daily. In the rare cases when problems come up I will tell you openly and you'll never see me disappear (I'm still astounded that this is a common problem with other freelancers)

3. Quick turnaround times and reliable, complete and accurate results ensured by me using Python and the scrapy framework (that's my strong recommendation if technology can be choosen freely) plus building everything in a test driven way (I’m the author of the scrapy_tdd testing library)

4. There's little that can stop me: anti scraping mechanisms (captchas, bandwidth throttling, IP banning) are easily overcome using a network of 3000+ proxy servers, the tor network plus my lateral thinking and well grounded education in computer science

5. Messy or strangely coded data is no problem as I'll clean it using my data mining experience plus OCR automation to handle data that's hidden in images (like emails in many business directories)

6. Top Secret: If required, I'll stay stealthy while scraping for you using my network of proxies or the infamous Tor network - as a result your scraping project won't ring your competitions' alarm bells and won't give away what your plans are


Or to put it into a shorter version:

“Ruediger has performed an outstanding job for us. He demonstrates a great deal of professionalism and technical excellence. I strongly endorse him without reservation!”
- a Client @upwork


So don’t wait to contact me. Invite me today and you might be posting such a happily raving review in a few weeks, too."

Should you get a data analyst?  A data scientist?  The answer is that it's too early for that.  You need a data strategy first.  And a plan with objectives.  Those objectives are what you can give to a data analyst or scientist.

But you don't really have that all figured out yet.  And you don't really have the time for it either...


Let me introduce myself.  I'm Stijn, and if you've made it this far down the page then I can help you.

I'm a data geek who understands that all the current data science hype is no more than just a means to an end.  The 'end' being business results.

How do I know?  Because I've worked in sales and business positions myself.  I did that for 8 years.  In a startup, a family business, and a corporation. I know you only care about insights that bring actual value to the table.  I know because I was once in your shoes.

Now you may be wondering whether I actually got the hard skills to go along with the business acumen?  I'll keep it short and simple.

I have won several data science competitions, beating hundreds of data scientists every time.  My secret?  Being able to think beyond code.  I've written blog posts on 2 of these wins that illustrate some of my thinking process.  You'll find these in my portfolio below.

Besides that I was also awarded ""Top Solver"" ranking on Crowdanalytix.com.  There are just about 10 people out of 20,000+ data scientists on the platform who managed to obtain this achievement.

Can I make clients happy too?  Here's what some have said about me:

✅ ""Stijn has that rare combination of business and technical understanding""
✅ ""Stijn is one of the best freelancers I've worked with. [...] I would highly recommend him for any data management projects.""
✅ ""You got that start-up mentality that I like, and prefer to work with""
✅ ""My project required creative thinking and Stijn delivered""


Are you looking for someone to bridge the gap between data and business value for you?  Perhaps gaining a competitive edge based on data?  Then we should talk.

I only start projects in which I know I can deliver you a positive ROI.  I'll find out during our conversation.

⭐""Adam is one of the best freelancers I've ever hired. He completed quality work within an extremely short time frame. Highly recommended freelancer!"" - Christian Mayer, CEO of Finxter.com ⭐

Are you tired of reading or listening to content full of mistakes made by non-native English speakers?

Do you wish that someone could create content who both understands what they are doing while also being engaging and interesting? 

Hi, I'm Adam, an expert writer, content, and video creator specializing in data science and python. 

⭐""Great & blazingly fast freelancer with high-quality work!"" ⭐

Here is why you'll wish we started working together sooner:

✅ Native English Speaker - My content is written in perfect US or UK English with zero errors. Videos are recorded in a soothing and engaging British English accent.

✅ Exceptionally Engaging Content - fed up with dull, lifeless programming tutorials you've seen hundreds of times already? Mine are full to the brim with the passion, joy, and excitement I feel for programming. 

✅ SEO Specialist - All articles include fully keyword optimized titles, H1 and H2 headings, internal and external links to quality domains, and a clear CTA at the end promoting your offer.

✅ Images, Code, and Examples - Articles are more than just words, so they all include a feature image, images throughout with appropriate captions, well-commented code examples, graphs, and a real-world application of the topic.

✅ Relatable - I learn new concepts about programming every single day, and so I know what it is like to be a learner and not understand things. Thus my content resonates deeply with readers, and they finish it confident they've just learned something new.

⭐""Extremely fast, responsive, high-quality freelancer skilled in writing, video content production, editing, blogging, data science, and coding!"" ⭐

My academic background is a 1st Class Degree in Mathematics and Russian from Durham University (top 5 in the UK). Math taught me to work through problems logically. Russian taught me effective communication. Combined, they create easy-to-follow content that anyone can understand.

Topics and libraries I love to write about: data science, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, python basics, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, spacy, NLTK, keras, fastai, web scraping with beautifulsoup and requests, scrapy, un/supervised learning techniques and the underlying theory.

If you feel we might be a good fit for each other, contact me today so we can discuss your needs further.

My duties involved collecting the data and building the dataset for a study that involved 302 adolescents across 5 time-points. We collected self-report data as well as Electronic Medical Record data, and I was responsible for integrating the data into one dataset and cleaning it. I also composed three manuscripts for publication and gained experience in writing for academic journals.

A leading UK supermarket chain hired me to build an analytics portal that helped predict and prevent burglaries.

Can you afford *not* to subject it to rigorous analysis? 

Hi, I'm David. A data scientist with broad academic background in statistics, mathematics, biochemistry, and actuarial science, I can rapidly translate the technical details of your project both into code and also into copy. 

I can help you with every aspect of the data science workflow, including processing, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, monitoring, and documentation. Recent projects include the creation of an early warning system for bank risk, the modeling of insurance losses, survey analysis for a pulmonary rehabilitation clinic, and the analysis of web traffic time series.

Typical workflow begins with an intake interview, the conduction of a literature review, the development of specifications, the translations of those specifications into code, and then the drafting of copy which explains the methodology to clients and to other stakeholders. 

I love to explain technical concepts to nontechnical people, a skill that I've honed through years of teaching and tutoring. Clients appreciate my optimistic, down-to-earth approach. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you soon!"
